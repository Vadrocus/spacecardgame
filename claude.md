A retro-styled space card battler with MTG-inspired mechanics, built with vanilla JavaScript and Canvas 2D rendering.

## Project Structure

```
src/
  game.js       - Main game logic, Game class, BattlefieldCard, combat system
  card.js       - Base Card class, rendering utilities
  data.js       - Card database loading, deck utilities
  engine.js     - Game engine, input handling, render loop
  decks/
    terran-deck.json   - Terran Consensus faction (51 cards)

```

## Core Mechanics

### Zones
- **Gate Zone**: Mana system - gates provide power to play cards
- **Orbit Zone**: Where ships deploy initially
- **Planet Zone**: Ground units can move here from orbit (split into P1/P2 areas)

### Combat System (MTG-style stack)
- Click friendly units to add/remove from attack group
- Click enemy to execute combined attack
- Defender deals damage to lowest-power attackers first
- All attackers' power combines for damage to defender
- Non-combatants (Survey Teams, Science ships, etc.) cannot attack

### Special Card Types
- **Dropships**: Land to spawn ground units
- **Carriers**: Deploy token ships (Liberator Carrier, Crystalline Carrier)
- **Survey Teams**: Tap to search for Planetary Shield Generator (10% + 1%/research)
- **Quantum Sensor**: Tap to draw a card and gain research
- **Equipment**: Attach to units for stat bonuses

### Resources
- **Research Points**: Gained from surveying, increases discovery chance
- **Energy**: Generated by structures (Orbital Factory, Crystal Nexus, etc.)

### Win Condition
- Control Planetary Shield Generator + tap Planetary Consciousness Core
